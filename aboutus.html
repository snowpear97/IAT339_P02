        <h3>Welcome to LINGO!</h3>
        <p>Whether you are studying for a course, preparing for your next overseas trip, or wanting to become a
          polyglot,
          Lingo has got the language books just for you! </p>
        <h4>What is Lingo?</h4>
        <p>Lingo is an online bookstore that sells books for language learners specifically. There are many bookstores
          that sell various types of fiction and non fiction books, but our team wanted to make a specific business that
          sells books for people who are trying to learn a new language. Examples of products that could be sold are
          language dictionaries, textbooks for various different languages, and possibly media in other languages for
          consumption. <br><br>
          Our bookstore is also a source of information to potential customers, providing information for language
          learners, and in essence is a gateway to basic learning resources for language learners. While it may be
          smaller
          compared to big retailers like Amazon which sells almost everything, Lingo will have more specialized books on
          languages for language learners who want to go further, or linguists who want to study and dive deeper into a
          language.</p>
        <h4>Who is this Bookstore aimed for?</h4>
        <p>Lingo will provide a niche to language learners only. Since it is a hub where all types of books for language
          learning is available at, those who are dedicated to learning a language would possibly browse through the
          item
          listing selections available to see what books would fit their needs. Additionally, it is a shop recommended
          to
          professors or teachers who are teaching the language, as it provides a resource for students to gather all
          relevant material for study of another language.</p>
